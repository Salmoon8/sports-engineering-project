# sports-engineering-project

This repository contains a 3D visualisation app for football projectile motion using the Python library Vpython.
- the user is allowed to chosse the initial distance, velocity and distance to target.
- click run to start live 3D visualisation and reset to return to initial conditions.
- the app calculates the maximum ball height, and height at goal (o if it deos not reach target )
- ball position is updated at every iteration using kinetics and momentum laws.

  ## run the project
- you have to have python installed, and the library Vpython. fork the repo to your local machine and run the command python sportstry.py the app should start on your local host port(64866).
