This repository contains a 3D visualisation app for football projectile motion using the Python library Vpython.
- the user is allowed to chosse the initial distance, velocity and distance to target.
- click run to start live 3D visualisation and reset to return to initial conditions.
- the app calculates the maximum ball height, and height at goal (o if it deos not reach target )
- ball position is updated at every iteration using kinetics and momentum laws.
